# German-Credit-Risk-Analysis

## Problem Statement
When evaluating loan applications, companies face the challenge of determining whether to approve or reject based on the applicant's credit risk.
Credit risk is the potential of a borrower to default on debt payments. <br>
There are two key risks involved: rejecting a good credit risk leads to a loss of business, while approving a bad credit risk results in financial losses for the company, including the principal amount. <br>
Effectively designing effective strategies for financial institutions to assess, predict, and manage the risk of borrower default. <br>

## Approach

***1. Scope Analysis: Exploration of Variables and Analysis of Redundancy*** :    <br>

In this phase, variables are explored and analyzed for redundancy within the dataset. The process involves retrieving German bank data, generating a variable list, removing irrelevant variables, creating essential covariates, identifying expected relationships, assessing observed consistency, and eliminating variables without meaningful connections. This ensures a focused dataset, enhancing the effectiveness of credit risk assessment and other analytical tasks.
